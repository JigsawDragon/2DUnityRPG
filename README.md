# 2DUnityRPG

## Project Breakdown
This project is the first project I have uploaded onto Github. As soon as I started using this tool, I decided to put up a project I worked on, with the assistance of a teacher of mine about a year ago. It contains the framework of a 2D RPG, including a pathfinder for click movement, and a few structures to show the layers on the project, as well as some pixel art sourced and spliced to create a nicer scene.
I don't have any expectations to ever complete this project, so I'm leaving an unfinished creation to just showcase what I had done previously.

## Some Edits
I remotely added the master branch and copied the README file from the main branch because I learned that Git cannot merge something with unrelated histories. That kind of makes sense. I probably deleted the main branch too.
